## My Research Project

### Introduction

Organisms are chronically exposed to thousands of chemicals in **environmental mixtures** (including soil, air, and water), and medical research has shown that a large proportion of chronic disease risk can be explained by multiple pathways of these exposures. Environmental mixtures typically consist of multiple continuous and correlated exposures with *nonlinear and interactive* relationships with key outcomes, such as those described in [Bangladesh Data](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2021.1962889). In addition to the *high dimensionality* of exposure data, a common obstacle to this work is measuring and controlling for confounders, especially when these confounders are highly correlated with exposures or with each other. There is still an open question as to how to control for confounders when multiple confounders are present and there is also the outstanding question of how a stochastic approach would perform in the presence of multiple confounders that are moderately or highly correlated and where there is a complex relationship between these confounders and the outcome of interest, either by excluding confounders or by including them in the kernel function. Thus, the goal of our work is ultimately to help environmental health scientists employ optimal machine learning or other flexible methods in environmental mixtures studies to obtain conclusions that are as reliable and valid as possible.

### Simulation Study

We consider two scenarios: (1) metals have a linear effect on the outcome, while confounders have a nonlinear and interactive effect on the outcome, and (2) metals and confounders both have nonlinear and interactive effects on the outcome, including a metal confounder interaction. Moderate multicollinearity is induced, and noise is added for variation. For each scenario, we simulate 200 datasets consisting of 1000 observations each to replicate the range of observations often found in prospective epidemiological studies. ![Correlation Matrix for Simulated Exposures and Covariates](Correlation%20Matrix.png).

## Shell Questions

-   Describe the difference between `cd`, `cd ..`, and `cd ~`.\
    `cd` and `cd ~` will always put the user in their home directory. On the other hand, `cd ..` will move the user up one directory. So, if they are /usr/bin/tmp, `cd ..` moves them to /usr/bin, while `cd ../..` moves them to /usr (i.e. up two levels). The user can use this indirection to access subdirectories too.

-   What is the purpose of the `chmod` command?\
    In Unix operating systems, the `chmod` command is used to change the access mode of a file. The name is an abbreviation of change mode. Which states that every file and directory has a set of permissions that control the permissions like who can read, write or execute the file. In this the permissions have three categories: read, write, and execute simultaneously represented by `r`, `w` and `x`. These letters combine together to form a specific permission for a group of users.

-   How would you display the value of the PATH environment variable?\
    I will enter `echo $PATH` in terminal to display the value of PATH environmental variable.

-   In the current folder, you have hundreds of files in `.csv`, `.log`, `.out` format.\

    -   How to count the line numbers of each `.csv` file?\
        Open new terminal at folder, and enter `cat filename.csv  | wc -l` to get the line numbers.

    -   How to print the last line of each `.log` file?\
        Open new terminal at folder, and enter `tail -n 1 filename.log` to get the line numbers.

    -   How to print a list of `.out` files that contains `Error` somewhere in the file, and also print the line that includes `Error`? \
        Open new terminal at folder, and enter `grep -i "Error" *.out` to get the line numbers.

-   How would you print the second column of a space-separated file (for example, `test_data.out`) using `awk`? \
     Enter `$ awk '{ print $2 }' filename` to terminal to get the second column.

-   Describe the difference between `ps`, `top`, `htop` commands. \
    `ps` produces a snapshot of all running processes. \
    `top` is used to discover resource-hungry processes. This Linux command will sort the list by CPU usage, so the process which consumes the most resources will be placed at the top. It’s also useful to check if a specific process is running. \
    Both the `htop` and `top` commands display the same information when listing Linux processes, but the former offers user-friendly features that are great for everyday process management. The `htop` command allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally. As such, you can see the complete list of Linux processes along with their full command lines. What’s more, the command allows you to use a mouse to select items, kill processes without inserting their PIDs, change the priority of multiple processes easily, and so on.
