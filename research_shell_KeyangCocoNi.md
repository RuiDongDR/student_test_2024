# Research: Large Language Model on Genetic Data

This is a project I have been working on with *Yutian Chen* and *Jiannan Yang* since Feb 2023, when we were all students from City University of Hong Kong.


## Project Objectives
 -   Introduce large language models to the training on genetic data and utilize this model for some down-stream tasks.
 -   Pre-training on the single-cell data.
    -   Self-supervised learning
    -   Large language model: BERT, Transformer
    -   Genetic data (TCGA and [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/archive-download)…)
    -   Code: HuggingFace Transformers
 - Pre-training on chemical structures (SMILE).
- **Down-stream task:** predict drug efficiency with pre-trained embeddings of cell lines and chemical structures, based on drug sensitivity data from [GDSC](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/).

> Our result is far from satisfactory, so we are still working on it.

# Shell questions

## Describe the difference between `cd`, `cd ..`, and `cd ~`.

`cd particular-directory` is commonly used to change the current working directory to a particular directory. Sometimes when used without specifying a destination directory, `cd` can change the current working directory to the user's home directory (`/home/username`).
`cd ..` is used to change the current working directory to its parent directory.
`cd ~` can change the current working directory to the user's home directory (`/home/username`), which is identical to `cd` used alone. 

## What is the purpose of the `chmod` command?
The purpose of `chmod` command is to change the file mode of a file or directory, in terms of the access permissions (read, write, execute) for different sets of users (owner, group, others). 

## How would you display the value of the PATH environment variable?

     echo $PATH

## In the current folder, you have hunderds of files in `.csv`, `.log`, `.out` format.
### How to count the line numbers of each `.csv` file?

    wc -l *.csv

### How to print the last line of each `.log` file?

    tail -n 1 *.log
### How to print a list of `.out` files that contains `Error` somewhere in the file, and also print the line that includes `Error`?

    find . -type f -name "*.out" -exec grep -Hn "Error" {} +

## How would you print the second column of a space-separated file (for example, `test_data.out`) using `awk`?

    awk '{print $2}' test_data.out


## Describe the difference between `ps`, `top`, `htop` commands.
`ps` provides a static table of the processes running currently, with PID (process ID), TTY (the associated terminal ), TIME (the CPU time used), CMD (the command that launched the process) as columns.
`top` provides a dynamic table of the processes running currently, with USER, PR, NI, VIRT, RES,    SHR, S, %CPU,  %MEM,  TIME+, COMMAND as columns. Compared with `ps`, `top` also displays overall system statistics, such as CPU, memory usage, and swap usage. It is also interactive and can accept user inputs.
`htop` provides a more user-friendly (colorful) dynamic table of the processes running currently. The output has PID, USER, PR, NI, VIRT, RES,    SHR, S, %CPU,  %MEM,  TIME+, COMMAND as columns, which is a combination of the info provided by `top` and `ps`. It also has overall system statistics, but it visualizes the statistics into bars, which is more intuitive than `top`.
